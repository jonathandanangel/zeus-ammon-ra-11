"Thou shalt not worship the Sun, who is named Adonai, whose name is also Kadush and El-El" (Cod. Naz., I, 47; see also Psalm lxxxix., 18), and also "Lord Bacchus."`,

Of Simeon and Levi the patriarch remarks that they "are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly."

Now in the original, the words "their secret" really are "their SOD." And Sod was the name for the great mysteries of Baal, Adonis and Bacchus, who were all sun-gods and had serpents for symbols.`,

From the earliest mental conceptions of man, it was known as that which represented most successfully the origin and secret of being.

The "First Cause" had no name in the beginnings. Later it was pictured in the fancy of the thinkers as an ever invisible, mysterious Bird that dropped an Egg into Chaos, which Egg becomes the Universe. Hence Brahm was called Kalahansa, "the swan in (Space and) Time." He became the "Swan of Eternity," who lays at the beginning of each Mahamanvantara a "Golden Egg."`,

Ra is shown like Brahma gestating in the Egg of the Universe. The deceased is "resplendent in the Egg of the land of mysteries." "It is the Egg of the great clucking Hen, the Egg of Seb, who issues from it like a hawk."`,

Those pillars were built by Seth — not the Patriarch, nor Teth, Set, Thoth, Tat, Sat (the later Sat-an), or Hermes, who are all one — but by the "sons of the Serpent-god," or "Sons of the Dragon," the name under which the Hierophants of Egypt and Babylon were known before the Deluge, as were their forefathers, the Atlanteans.`,

The shadow of the deity, Kosmic and universal, of that which broods over and permeates the egg with its vivifying Spirit until the germ contained in it is ripe, was the mystery god whose name was unpronounceable. It is Phtah, however, "he who opens," the opener of life and Death, who proceeds from the egg of the world to begin his dual work. (Book of Numbers.)
